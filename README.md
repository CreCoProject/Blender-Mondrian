# Blender-Wireframe-Play
This is a Study in WireFrame Models.
It is inspired by the Mondrian Study.
In this Study I will prove to make Art
in the Style of Piet Mondrian.
Here I will play with the Idea of Wireframe
Models. This are Models in which the Shape
of Objects are modified to WireFrames.
This will calls the Question of Forms
and Colors finsched in the Question of
the Correlation of Form and Color.
I hope this little Experiments inspired
somebody to make own Experiments with
Colors and WireFrames.
